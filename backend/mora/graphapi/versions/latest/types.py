        Scalar implementing the danish national identification number / civil registration number.

        The number is a unique identifier for a single individual, although individuals may go through several numbers over time.

        The number is expected to have 10 digits, 6 digits defining a date, and a 4 digit serial number.
        The number does not have to fulfill the modulo 11 checksum.
        It does however (optionally) have to define a valid date.
        No dash should be included to separate the date and serial number sections.

        Note:

        As the cursor is to be considered opaque its implementation may change in the future.
        I.e. in the future it may be implemented as a simple integer or a complex object.

        The caller should not concern themselves with the actual value contained within, but rather simply pass whatever is returned in the `cursor` argument to continue iteration.
