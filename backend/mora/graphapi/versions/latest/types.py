        Scalar implementing the danish national identification number / civil registration number.

        The number is a unique identifier for a single individual, although individuals may go through several numbers over time.

        The number is expected to have 10 digits, 6 digits defining a date, and a 4 digit serial number.
        The number does not have to fulfill the modulo 11 checksum.
        It does however (optionally) have to define a valid date.
        No dash should be included to separate the date and serial number sections.
