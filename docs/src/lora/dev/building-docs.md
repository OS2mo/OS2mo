title: Building documentation
---

This README file is part of our documentation, and an HTML version can
be obtained by the following command in a command prompt:

``` bash
$ make -C doc
```

Note that this requires Sphinx to be installed --- on Ubuntu or Debian,
this can be done with the following command:

``` bash
$ sudo apt install python-sphinx
```
